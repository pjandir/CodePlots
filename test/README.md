# Example

This example shows a few ways to use this tool to plot and/or analyze data. Both plots and tables can be produced efficiently. Use the Run.C script to run this example out 
of the box (assuming of course ROOT has been installed already). The data samples (in files/) included in this directory are 7 TeV 2011 CMS data. It has been slightly 
modified from its original source to include several additional variables. Credit goes to Christian Sander & Alexander Schmidt who produced these samples for educational 
purposes. Please see this [link](http://ippog.web.cern.ch/resources/2012/cms-hep-tutorial) for further details on these files and their associated tutorial.
